# php-summit-2013-javascript

Example and demonstration code created during the php-summit-2013 javascript session

This code is available here for every participant of the session to play and experiment with.

## Setup

To initialize the different variants of the example code [bower](http://bower.io/) is needed, which in turn needs [nodejs](http://nodejs.org).

After installing **nodejs**. Please run the following command:

  npm install bower -g
  
After that you may run `bower install` inside of each of the example code directories to install all needed libraries and dependencies.
